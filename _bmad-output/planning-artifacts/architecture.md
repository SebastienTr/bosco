# Architecture Decision Document

_This document builds collaboratively through step-by-step discovery. Sections are appended as we work through each architectural decision together._

## Project Context Analysis

### Requirements Overview

**Functional Requirements:**
9 FRs covering the full product surface: authentication (magic link), user profiles with public pages, voyage CRUD, GPX import with client-side processing pipeline (parse → simplify → GeoJSON), automatic stopover detection and reverse geocoding, log entries with photo attachments, public voyage pages with animated route rendering, public profile pages, and an authenticated dashboard. The GPX import pipeline (FR-4) and public voyage rendering (FR-7) carry the highest architectural complexity.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
18 NFRs organized across 5 categories:
- **Performance (4):** 2s first paint on 4G (NFR-1), 400MB GPX import in <60s with <200ms input lag (NFR-2), 60fps map interaction (NFR-3), 100k points with <100ms interaction latency (NFR-4)
- **Security (4):** User data isolation via RLS (NFR-5/6), image upload validation (NFR-7), XSS prevention (NFR-8)
- **Mobile (4):** Mobile-first 375px+ (NFR-9), touch map interactions (NFR-10), mobile file picker + share sheet (NFR-11), image compression <1MB (NFR-12)
- **SEO (3):** SSR with complete HTML (NFR-13), Open Graph meta tags (NFR-14), structured data (NFR-15)
- **i18n (3):** English UI (NFR-16), externalized strings (NFR-17), nautical units with future-proof design (NFR-18)

**UX Architectural Implications:**
- PWA with Web Share Target registration — service worker and manifest required
- Full-bleed map as primary UI canvas — Leaflet with OpenSeaMap nautical overlay
- Route animation on public page first load — programmatic polyline drawing
- Glass morphism overlays (Direction D: translucent navy + backdrop blur)
- Bottom sheet pattern for stopover details — draggable, swipe-to-dismiss
- Dual design system: shadcn/ui (creator) + custom Tailwind (public)
- 3 breakpoints: mobile 375px, tablet 768px, desktop 1024px+
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance including prefers-reduced-motion support

**Scale & Complexity:**

- Primary domain: Full-stack web (PWA)
- Complexity level: Moderate
- Estimated architectural components: ~15 (auth, profiles, voyages, legs, stopovers, log entries, GPX parser, simplifier, GeoJSON converter, stopover detector, reverse geocoder, map renderer, route animator, image compressor, PWA service worker)

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

- **Supabase** as backend (Auth + Postgres + Storage + RLS) — accessed exclusively through abstraction layers, never directly from components
- **Leaflet** requires dynamic import with `ssr: false` in Next.js (window dependency)
- **Nominatim** external API for reverse geocoding — free, rate-limited (1 req/sec policy). Must be treated as asynchronous and non-blocking: stopovers display with coordinates first, names resolve progressively. Graceful degradation if Nominatim is unavailable.
- **Client-side GPX processing** in a Web Worker (architectural constraint, not optional) — browser memory and CPU constraints on mobile. Worker communication via simple message protocol: `{ type: 'process', file }` → `{ tracks, stopovers }` with intermediate `{ type: 'progress', step }` messages.
- **Douglas-Peucker** must be iterative (stack-based) to handle 1M+ points without stack overflow
- **No raw GPX storage** — only simplified GeoJSON persisted server-side
- **Vercel** deployment — serverless functions, edge network, no persistent server state

### Vendor Strategy Decision

**Decision: Option B — Lightweight Abstractions over Supabase**

Supabase is used for MVP speed (Auth, Postgres, Storage, RLS), but all access is mediated through thin abstraction layers to enable future migration without full rewrite.

**Abstraction boundaries:**
- **Data access:** Next.js Server Actions and API routes as the data layer. No direct Supabase client calls from React components. Components call server functions; server functions call Supabase.
- **Auth:** Wrapper module (`src/lib/auth.ts`) exposing `signIn`, `signOut`, `getUser`, `requireAuth`. Supabase Auth is the implementation. Swappable to Auth.js, Lucia, or custom JWT without touching calling code.
- **Storage:** Single file (`src/lib/storage.ts`) from day 1 concentrating all storage calls. Formal abstraction interface introduced when photo features are implemented.
- **Authorization:** RLS retained as database-level safety net. Application-level authorization also enforced in Server Actions (belt and suspenders). If RLS is removed in a future migration, the app-level checks remain.

**Data access layer:** Repository functions in `src/lib/data/` encapsulate all database queries. Server Actions call these functions, never the Supabase client directly. Migration means rewriting only `src/lib/data/*.ts` files — zero changes in Server Actions, components, or pages.

**Containment rule (3 tiers):**
1. `@supabase/supabase-js` → only inside `src/lib/supabase/`
2. `src/lib/supabase/*` → only imported by `src/lib/data/`, `src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/lib/storage.ts`
3. Server Actions → import only from `src/lib/data/`, `src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/lib/storage.ts`
4. Components → call only Server Actions

Any import that skips a tier is a code review failure.

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- Slightly more boilerplate than direct Supabase client usage
- Additional indirection layer (server function between component and DB)
- RLS policies maintained in parallel with app-level checks (some duplication)

**Benefits gained:**
- Supabase can be replaced component-by-component without full rewrite
- Server Actions provide a natural API boundary for future extraction
- App-level authorization survives any database migration
- Client bundle never contains database credentials or direct DB logic

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

1. **Authentication & Authorization** — Supabase Auth (magic link) behind auth wrapper + RLS policies on all 5 tables + app-level checks in Server Actions. Anon key for public reads, authenticated key for writes. Middleware for route protection.
2. **Client-Side File Processing** — GPX parsing, track simplification, GeoJSON conversion, stats computation. All in-browser via dedicated Web Worker. Simple message protocol for Worker ↔ main thread communication with progress feedback.
3. **Image Optimization** — Client-side compression to <1MB before Supabase Storage upload. Applies to profile photos, boat photos, voyage covers, log entry photos.
4. **SEO & Social Sharing** — SSR for public pages, dynamic OG meta tags per voyage, JSON-LD structured data. Critical for the viral sharing loop.
5. **PWA Infrastructure** — Service worker, web app manifest, share target registration. Core to the Android import flow.
6. **Accessibility** — WCAG 2.1 AA across all pages, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, motion preferences. Integrated into component design, not bolted on.
7. **Internationalization Readiness** — English-only MVP with externalized strings and unit abstractions for future French UI and unit toggle. Strings externalized via collocated `messages.ts` files (see Implementation Patterns).

## Starter Template Evaluation

### Primary Technology Domain

Full-stack web (PWA) based on project requirements: Next.js with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase backend, Leaflet maps, PWA with Web Share Target.

### Version Update

Architecture notes referenced Next.js 15. As of March 2026, Next.js 16.1 is the latest stable release (December 2025) with stable Turbopack, React 19.2, Cache Components, and file system caching. The project targets Next.js 16.

### Starter Options Considered

| Option | Stack | Verdict |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `create-next-app` + `shadcn init` | Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui | **Selected** — clean foundation, full control over abstraction layers |
| Vercel Supabase Starter | Next.js + Supabase + Auth boilerplate | Rejected — direct Supabase calls from components violate Option B containment rule |
| T3 Stack (`create-t3-app`) | Next.js + tRPC + Prisma + Tailwind | Rejected — tRPC and Prisma incompatible with Server Actions + Supabase architecture |
| Community starters (Nextbase, etc.) | Full SaaS boilerplate | Rejected — too much unwanted complexity, unclear maintenance |

### Selected Starter: create-next-app + shadcn/ui

**Rationale:** Cleanest foundation for Option B vendor strategy. No pre-baked Supabase patterns to fight against. Full control over abstraction boundaries from day 1. Official tooling with strong maintenance guarantees.

**Initialization Commands:**

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest bosco --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --turbopack --import-alias "@/*"
cd bosco
npx shadcn@latest init -d
```

**Architectural Decisions Provided by Starter:**

**Language & Runtime:**
- TypeScript strict mode
- React 19.2 (via Next.js 16)
- Node.js runtime for server components and Server Actions

**Styling Solution:**
- Tailwind CSS 4 with PostCSS
- shadcn/ui component library (copy-paste model, Radix UI primitives)
- CSS variables for theming (Ocean & Sunset palette configured in tailwind.config.ts)

**Build Tooling:**
- Turbopack for development (stable in Next.js 16)
- Webpack for production builds
- ESLint for code quality

**Testing Framework:**
- Not included by starter — to be decided in architectural decisions step

**Code Organization:**
- `src/` directory with App Router structure
- `@/*` import alias for clean imports
- shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/`

**Development Experience:**
- Turbopack hot reload
- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint integration

**Backend Architecture:**
- No separate backend service. Next.js Server Actions and API routes serve as the backend layer, running as serverless functions on Vercel.
- All server-side logic (auth, CRUD, SSR, OG tags, reverse geocoding proxy) runs within Next.js.
- Sufficient for MVP requirements: no WebSocket, no long-running tasks, no background jobs.
- Option B abstractions enable future extraction to a separate backend if needed.

**Additional Setup Required (post-initialization):**
- Supabase client libraries (`@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`)
- Abstraction layer files (`src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/lib/storage.ts`, `src/lib/supabase/`)
- Leaflet + react-leaflet (dynamic import with `ssr: false`)
- PWA setup: Serwist (maintained next-pwa successor) or native Next.js manifest + custom service worker for Web Share Target
- OpenSeaMap tile layer configuration

**Note:** Project initialization using these commands should be the first implementation story.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**
- Data access pattern via Supabase JS client behind Server Actions
- Zod validation on all Server Action inputs
- Supabase CLI migrations (SQL files, version-controlled)
- React local state management (no global store for MVP)

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**
- Vitest + Playwright testing stack
- Vercel auto-deploy + GitHub Actions CI
- Sentry error tracking + Vercel Analytics

**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**
- Global state library (Zustand) — only if needed
- Advanced caching (TanStack Query) — only if refetch patterns get complex
- CDN configuration tuning — Vercel defaults sufficient for MVP

### Data Architecture

| Decision | Choice | Version | Rationale |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Data access | Supabase JS client behind `src/lib/data/` | latest | Query builder used exclusively inside `src/lib/data/*.ts` repository functions. Server Actions call repository functions, never the Supabase client. Migration = rewrite `src/lib/data/` only. |
| Validation | Zod | 4.x | Validates all Server Action inputs. Generates TypeScript types. Standard pairing with Next.js Server Actions. |
| Migrations | Supabase CLI | latest | SQL files in `supabase/migrations/`. Version-controlled, reproducible, compatible with Supabase dashboard and local dev. |
| Caching | Next.js built-in | 16.x | Cache Components + Vercel CDN for public SSR pages. No client-side cache library for MVP. |
| Type generation | Supabase CLI `gen types` | latest | Auto-generates TypeScript types from database schema. Single source of truth for data types. |

### Authentication & Security

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Auth provider | Supabase Auth (magic link) behind `src/lib/auth.ts` wrapper | Decided in step 2 (Option B). |
| Route protection | Next.js middleware | Checks auth state on protected routes, redirects to `/auth` if unauthenticated. |
| Authorization | RLS + app-level checks in Server Actions | Belt and suspenders. RLS as safety net, Server Actions as primary enforcement. |
| Input validation | Zod schemas on every Server Action | Prevents malformed data at the boundary. |
| File upload validation | Type + size check (max 10MB) in Server Action | Before forwarding to Supabase Storage. |
| CSP headers | Next.js `headers()` config | Restrictive CSP allowing Supabase, OpenStreetMap tile servers, Nominatim, and Sentry. |

### API & Communication Patterns

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Primary API pattern | Next.js Server Actions (`'use server'`) | Decided in step 2. Components call server functions, never Supabase directly. |
| Public data fetching | Server Components (direct) | Public pages use server components to fetch data at render time. No API route needed. |
| Reverse geocoding | API route (`/api/geocode`) as proxy | Rate-limits and caches Nominatim calls server-side. Prevents client from hitting Nominatim directly. |
| Error handling | Typed return values (`{ data, error }`) | Server Actions return structured results, never throw. Components handle errors explicitly. |
| File uploads | Server Action with `FormData` | Receives compressed image, validates, forwards to Supabase Storage via `src/lib/storage.ts`. |

### Frontend Architecture

| Decision | Choice | Version | Rationale |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| State management | React local state (`useState`, `useReducer`) | — | No global store needed. Import flow uses `useReducer` for multi-step state. |
| Global store (deferred) | Zustand | — | Only introduced if shared state need emerges. Not for MVP. |
| Map library | Leaflet + react-leaflet | latest | Dynamic import with `ssr: false`. OpenSeaMap tile overlay. |
| Fonts | DM Serif Display + Nunito (Google Fonts) | — | Loaded via `next/font` for optimal performance. |
| Image optimization | `next/image` for static, client-side compression for uploads | — | Browser-based compression to <1MB before upload. |
| Animations | CSS transitions + Leaflet polyline animation | — | No Framer Motion for MVP. Route animation via progressive polyline drawing. |
| PWA | Serwist (next-pwa successor) or native service worker | latest | Web Share Target registration for Android import flow. |

### Infrastructure & Deployment

| Decision | Choice | Version | Rationale |
|----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Hosting | Vercel | — | Native Next.js support, preview deploys, edge CDN. |
| CI checks | GitHub Actions | — | Lint + type-check + Vitest on PR. Playwright on main. |
| Deploy | Vercel auto-deploy | — | Preview on PR push, production on main merge. |
| Unit/Integration testing | Vitest | 4.x | Fast, TypeScript-native, compatible with Next.js. |
| E2E testing | Playwright | 1.58.x | Cross-browser, reliable, good Next.js integration. |
| Error tracking | Sentry (`@sentry/nextjs`) | 10.x | Free tier sufficient. Captures server + client errors. |
| Performance monitoring | Vercel Analytics | — | Built-in Web Vitals tracking. |
| Local development | Supabase CLI (local Postgres + Auth) | latest | `supabase start` for local dev. No cloud dependency during development. |

### AI Agent Development Principles

All code must be optimized for AI agent comprehension and debugging. These principles are architectural constraints, not guidelines.

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Explicit errors, never silent** | All Server Actions return `{ data, error }` with a human-readable message. No empty catch blocks. No swallowed exceptions. |
| **Structured logging** | `console.error` with context: action name, user id, input summary. Agents can grep and trace issues through logs. |
| **File name = responsibility** | One file = one clear responsibility. `src/lib/auth.ts` does auth. `src/app/voyage/[id]/actions.ts` does voyage actions. No ambiguity about where to look. |
| **No magic** | No implicit re-exports, no complex barrel files, no deeply nested HOCs. Code reads linearly top-to-bottom. An agent follows the call chain without jumping through indirection. |
| **Strict types everywhere** | Zero `any`. Supabase generated types + Zod schemas cover all data boundaries. An agent always knows the shape of data flowing through the system. |
| **Predictable naming conventions** | Server Actions: verb + noun (`createVoyage`, `deleteStopover`, `importTracks`). Files: `src/app/{feature}/actions.ts` for actions, `src/lib/{domain}.ts` for utilities. An agent guesses correctly where code lives. |
| **Collocated logic** | Server Actions live next to the pages that use them. No distant action files. An agent reads one directory to understand a feature. |
| **Typed error boundaries** | Each error has a category and message. `{ error: { code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR', message: 'Invalid GPX format' } }`. Agents classify and fix by category. |

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. Project init (`create-next-app` + `shadcn init`)
2. Supabase setup (local CLI + migrations + type generation)
3. Abstraction layers (`src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/lib/supabase/`, `src/lib/storage.ts`)
4. Auth flow (magic link + middleware + route protection)
5. Core CRUD (voyages, profiles via Server Actions)
6. Map integration (Leaflet dynamic import + OpenSeaMap)
7. GPX processing (Web Worker + Douglas-Peucker)
8. Public pages (SSR + OG tags + animation)
9. PWA setup (service worker + share target)

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**
- Auth wrapper must exist before any Server Action (all actions use `requireAuth`)
- Supabase type generation must run after each migration (types feed Server Actions + components)
- Map component must be dynamic-imported before any map feature
- Web Worker setup must precede GPX import feature
- Sentry init must be early in the stack (catches errors from all layers)

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

### Pattern Categories Defined

**Critical Conflict Points Identified:** 5 categories where AI agents could make incompatible choices — naming, structure, formats, communication, and process patterns. All patterns below are mandatory for any agent working on this codebase.

### Naming Patterns

**Database Naming Conventions:**
- Tables: `snake_case`, plural → `voyages`, `log_entries`, `stopovers`
- Columns: `snake_case` → `user_id`, `started_at`, `avg_speed_kts`
- Foreign keys: `{singular_table}_id` → `voyage_id`, `leg_id`
- Indexes: `idx_{table}_{columns}` → `idx_voyages_user_id`
- Enums: `snake_case` → `visibility_type`

**Code Naming Conventions:**
- Component files: `PascalCase.tsx` → `VoyageCard.tsx`, `StopoverSheet.tsx`
- Utility/lib files: `kebab-case.ts` → `stopover-detection.ts`, `reverse-geocode.ts`
- Server Action files: `actions.ts` (collocated in route directory)
- Functions: `camelCase` → `createVoyage`, `detectStopovers`
- Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase` → `Voyage`, `Stopover`, `ImportResult`
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` → `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_STOPOVER_RADIUS_KM`
- Server Actions: `verbNoun` pattern → `createVoyage`, `deleteStopover`, `importTracks`

**API Naming Conventions:**
- No REST routes. Server Actions are the API surface.
- Only API route: `/api/geocode` (Nominatim proxy)
- Query parameters (if any): `camelCase`

### Structure Patterns

**Project Organization (feature-based):**
- Components organized by feature domain, not by type
- `src/components/map/` → all map-related components
- `src/components/voyage/` → all voyage-related components
- `src/components/gpx/` → all GPX import-related components
- `src/components/log/` → all log entry components
- `src/components/ui/` → shadcn/ui only (never place custom components here)

**Lib Organization (domain-based):**
- `src/lib/supabase/` → `client.ts`, `server.ts`, `middleware.ts` (containment zone)
- `src/lib/auth.ts` → auth wrapper (`signIn`, `signOut`, `getUser`, `requireAuth`)
- `src/lib/storage.ts` → storage wrapper (`uploadFile`, `getPublicUrl`, `deleteFile`)
- `src/lib/gpx/` → `parser.ts`, `simplify.ts`, `to-geojson.ts`, `worker.ts`
- `src/lib/geo/` → `distance.ts`, `stopover-detection.ts`, `reverse-geocode.ts`
- `src/lib/utils/` → `format.ts`, `image.ts`

**Test Location:**
- Unit/integration tests: co-located next to tested file → `actions.test.ts` beside `actions.ts`
- E2E tests: `tests/e2e/` at project root
- Test naming: `describe('{functionName}')` → `it('should ...')`

**File Structure Rules:**
- Config files at project root: `next.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`
- Environment files: `.env.local` (local dev), `.env.example` (committed template)
- Supabase: `supabase/migrations/` for SQL migrations
- Types: `src/types/` for shared types, `src/types/supabase.ts` for generated DB types

### Format Patterns

**Server Action Return Format (mandatory):**

```typescript
// Success
{ data: T, error: null }

// Error
{ data: null, error: { code: ErrorCode, message: string } }
```

**Standardized Error Codes:**
- `VALIDATION_ERROR` — invalid input (Zod failure)
- `NOT_FOUND` — resource does not exist
- `UNAUTHORIZED` — not authenticated
- `FORBIDDEN` — authenticated but not authorized
- `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR` — Nominatim down, Supabase error
- `PROCESSING_ERROR` — GPX parsing failure, image compression failure

**Date/Time Formats:**
- Database: `TIMESTAMPTZ` always (UTC storage)
- JSON/Server Actions: ISO 8601 string (`2026-03-15T14:30:00Z`)
- UI display: formatted locally via `Intl.DateTimeFormat`
- Never store dates as epoch integers

**GeoJSON Format:**
- Standard GeoJSON `LineString` for tracks
- Coordinates in `[longitude, latitude]` order (GeoJSON spec, NOT `[lat, lng]`)
- This is critical: Leaflet uses `[lat, lng]` internally — conversion happens in the map component layer, never in stored data

**JSON Field Naming:**
- Database fields: `snake_case` (Postgres convention)
- TypeScript interfaces: `camelCase` (auto-mapped by Supabase client)
- No manual case conversion needed — Supabase JS client handles this

### Communication Patterns

**Web Worker Messages:**

```typescript
// Main → Worker
{ type: 'process', file: File }

// Worker → Main (progress)
{ type: 'progress', step: 'parsing' | 'simplifying' | 'detecting' | 'ready' }

// Worker → Main (result)
{ type: 'result', data: { tracks: GeoJSON[], stopovers: Stopover[], stats: TrackStats[] } }

// Worker → Main (error)
{ type: 'error', error: { code: string, message: string } }
```

**State Management Patterns:**
- Server state: Server Components fetch data at render time. No client-side cache.
- Client state: `useState` for simple state, `useReducer` for multi-step flows (GPX import).
- Form state: `react-hook-form` + Zod resolver for creator forms.
- No global store for MVP. If needed later, Zustand with single-purpose stores.
- State updates are always immutable (spread operator, never direct mutation).

### Process Patterns

**Loading State Patterns:**
- Server Components: `loading.tsx` file per route segment (Next.js convention)
- Client interactions: local `isLoading` boolean in the component
- GPX import: Worker progress messages drive UI (`parsing` → `simplifying` → `detecting` → `ready`)
- Never a generic spinner — always a contextual message describing what is happening

**Form Patterns:**
- Zod schema defined first, form built on top of it
- Client-side validation (fast UX) + server-side validation (security) using the same Zod schema
- shadcn/ui `Form` component + `react-hook-form` for creator forms
- Inline validation on blur, error message below field in Error red
- Pseudo field: real-time availability check with debounce

**i18n Readiness Pattern (NFR-17):**
- No i18n library for MVP (English only)
- All user-facing strings externalized in a collocated `messages.ts` file per route or feature
- Example: `src/app/dashboard/messages.ts` exports `{ title: 'My Voyages', empty: 'Create your first voyage' }`
- Components import from `messages.ts`, never inline string literals for UI text
- When French UI is needed (Growth phase): replace `messages.ts` files with `next-intl` translation files — same keys, zero component changes
- Units (nm, kts) formatted via `src/lib/utils/format.ts` — already abstracted for future unit toggle

**Error Boundary Patterns:**
- `error.tsx` per route segment (Next.js convention)
- Global fallback: "Something went wrong" + retry button
- GPX errors: specific message + link to supported formats
- Network errors: "Check your connection" + retry
- Never a blank screen — every error state has a recovery path

### Enforcement Guidelines

**All AI Agents MUST:**
1. Follow naming conventions exactly — no exceptions, no "close enough"
2. Return `{ data, error }` from every Server Action — no throwing, no alternative formats
3. Place Supabase imports exclusively in `src/lib/` — containment rule is non-negotiable
4. Co-locate tests next to the file they test — no separate test directories for unit tests
5. Use `PascalCase.tsx` for components and `kebab-case.ts` for utilities — file naming is not optional
6. Store coordinates as `[longitude, latitude]` in GeoJSON — `[lat, lng]` only in Leaflet map layer

**Pattern Verification:**
- ESLint rules enforce import containment (`no-restricted-imports` for `@supabase/*` outside `src/lib/`)
- TypeScript strict mode catches type violations
- PR review checks naming conventions and return format compliance
- Vitest tests verify Server Action return format consistency

### Pattern Examples

**Good Example — Data Access Layer:**
```typescript
// src/lib/data/voyages.ts
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
import type { Voyage } from '@/types'

export async function insertVoyage(userId: string, name: string, description?: string) {
  return supabase
    .from('voyages')
    .insert({ user_id: userId, name, description })
    .select()
    .single()
}

export async function getVoyagesByUser(userId: string) {
  return supabase
    .from('voyages')
    .select('*')
    .eq('user_id', userId)
    .order('updated_at', { ascending: false })
}
```

**Good Example — Server Action (uses data layer, never Supabase):**
```typescript
// src/app/dashboard/actions.ts
'use server'

import { z } from 'zod'
import { requireAuth } from '@/lib/auth'
import { insertVoyage } from '@/lib/data/voyages'

const CreateVoyageSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1).max(100),
  description: z.string().optional(),
})

export async function createVoyage(formData: FormData) {
  const user = await requireAuth()
  const parsed = CreateVoyageSchema.safeParse(Object.fromEntries(formData))

  if (!parsed.success) {
    return { data: null, error: { code: 'VALIDATION_ERROR', message: parsed.error.issues[0].message } }
  }

  const { data, error } = await insertVoyage(user.id, parsed.data.name, parsed.data.description)

  if (error) {
    return { data: null, error: { code: 'EXTERNAL_SERVICE_ERROR', message: error.message } }
  }

  return { data, error: null }
}
```

**Anti-Patterns:**
```typescript
// ❌ Direct Supabase import in a component
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase/client'
// Components NEVER import Supabase directly

// ❌ Throwing from Server Actions
throw new Error('Voyage not found')
// ALWAYS return { data: null, error: { code, message } }

// ❌ Generic spinner
<Spinner />
// ALWAYS use contextual message: "Loading your voyages..."

// ❌ Coordinates as [lat, lng] in stored data
{ coordinates: [48.279, -4.595] }
// ALWAYS [longitude, latitude] in GeoJSON: [-4.595, 48.279]

// ❌ any type
const data: any = await fetchData()
// ALWAYS use generated Supabase types or Zod inferred types

// ❌ Server Action importing Supabase directly
import { supabase } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
// Server Actions import from src/lib/data/, src/lib/auth.ts, src/lib/storage.ts — NEVER from src/lib/supabase/
```

### Architectural Boundaries

**3-Tier Containment (Supabase Isolation):**

```
Tier 1: src/lib/supabase/     ← only place that imports @supabase/supabase-js
    ↓
Tier 2: src/lib/data/         ← repository functions (queries)
         src/lib/auth.ts       ← auth wrapper
         src/lib/storage.ts    ← storage wrapper
    ↓
Tier 3: src/app/*/actions.ts  ← Server Actions (business logic + validation)
    ↓
Tier 4: src/components/       ← React components (UI only)
         src/app/*/page.tsx    ← Pages
```

**Migration path (quit Supabase):** Replace Tier 1 + Tier 2 only. Tiers 3 and 4 remain untouched.

**SSR Boundary:**
- `src/app/[pseudo]/` and `src/app/[pseudo]/[slug]/` → Server Components (SSR, SEO, OG)
- `src/app/dashboard/`, `src/app/voyage/` → authenticated, server components with client islands

**Client-Only Boundary:**
- `src/components/map/*` → dynamically imported (`ssr: false`), Leaflet requires `window`
- `src/components/gpx/*` → client components, orchestrate Web Worker
- `src/lib/gpx/worker.ts` → runs in Web Worker context, no DOM access

### Data Flow

```
Component → Server Action → src/lib/data/*.ts → src/lib/supabase/server.ts → Supabase Postgres
                          → src/lib/auth.ts → src/lib/supabase/server.ts → Supabase Auth
                          → Zod validation (at Server Action level)

GPX File → Web Worker (src/lib/gpx/worker.ts)
         → parser.ts → simplify.ts → to-geojson.ts
         → Main thread → Server Action → src/lib/data/legs.ts → Supabase

Image → Client compression (src/lib/utils/image.ts)
      → Server Action → src/lib/storage.ts → src/lib/supabase/server.ts → Supabase Storage
```

### FR → Structure Mapping

| FR | Primary Location | Dependencies |
|----|-----------------|--------------|
| FR-1 Auth | `src/app/auth/`, `src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/middleware.ts` | `src/lib/supabase/` |
| FR-2 Profile | `src/app/dashboard/profile/`, `src/components/profile/` | `src/lib/data/profiles.ts`, `src/lib/storage.ts` |
| FR-3 Voyages | `src/app/voyage/`, `src/app/dashboard/`, `src/components/voyage/` | `src/lib/data/voyages.ts` |
| FR-4 GPX Import | `src/app/voyage/[id]/import/`, `src/components/gpx/`, `src/lib/gpx/` | Web Worker, `src/lib/data/legs.ts`, `src/lib/geo/` |
| FR-5 Stopovers | `src/components/map/`, `src/lib/geo/` | `src/app/api/geocode/`, `src/lib/data/stopovers.ts` |
| FR-6 Log Entries | `src/components/log/` | `src/lib/data/log-entries.ts`, `src/lib/storage.ts` |
| FR-7 Public Voyage | `src/app/[pseudo]/[slug]/`, `src/components/map/`, `src/components/voyage/` | SSR, `src/lib/data/voyages.ts`, OG image |
| FR-8 Public Profile | `src/app/[pseudo]/` | SSR, `src/lib/data/profiles.ts` |
| FR-9 Dashboard | `src/app/dashboard/` | `src/lib/data/voyages.ts`, `src/components/voyage/VoyageCard.tsx` |

### External Integrations

| Service | Integration Point | Pattern |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| Supabase Auth | `src/lib/auth.ts` → `src/lib/supabase/` | Tier 2 wrapper |
| Supabase Postgres | `src/lib/data/*.ts` → `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` | Tier 2 repository |
| Supabase Storage | `src/lib/storage.ts` → `src/lib/supabase/` | Tier 2 wrapper |
| Nominatim | `src/app/api/geocode/route.ts` | API route proxy, cached, rate-limited |
| OpenStreetMap tiles | `src/components/map/MapCanvas.tsx` | Direct tile URL |
| OpenSeaMap tiles | `src/components/map/MapCanvas.tsx` | Overlay tile URL |
| Sentry | `sentry.*.config.ts` | SDK init at app root |
| Vercel Analytics | `src/app/layout.tsx` | `<Analytics />` component |

### Development Workflow

**Local development:**
```bash
supabase start                    # Local Postgres + Auth + Storage
npm run dev                       # Next.js dev server (Turbopack)
supabase gen types typescript     # Regenerate types after migration
```

**Adding a new migration:**
```bash
supabase migration new <name>     # Creates SQL file in supabase/migrations/
# Edit the SQL file
supabase db reset                 # Apply all migrations locally
supabase gen types typescript     # Update generated types
```

**Build and deploy:**
```bash
npm run build                     # Production build (Webpack)
npm run test                      # Vitest unit/integration
npx playwright test               # E2E tests
# Push to main → Vercel auto-deploys
```
